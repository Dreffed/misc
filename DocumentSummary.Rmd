-	Version is on premises, and Sun is moving all future development to Cloud
-	Sun Sustainment project in 2018 identified a number of constraints / opportunities and recommend that a version upgrade at minimum.
The scope of this project is to Plan the migration of the accounting system from current sun version to a future software.  The deliverable in 2020 will be a migration plan, including the following elements;
-	When the migration should occur
-	A recommendation as to which software should the migration be to.  Note this will probably involve a light system selection project, but should not involve a detailed RFP 
-	Identify any opportunities to be considered in the migration beyond the core accounting system (i.e. opportunities to not just replace like for like), such as Procurement and CPM/reporting.
-	Time effort and money estimates to do the migration
The Migration Plan should be completed by the end of April 2020.
